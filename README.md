# Pipeviewer

Pipeviewer is the companion repository for the "Hands-on Systems Programming with Rust"
online course I created and published with Packt.

This project replicates _some_ of the functionality of [pv], but the main focus of this
project is to walk students through a hands-on project to teach and demonstrate Rust
programming language features.  Each Git tag in this repository is for a commit that
corresponds to one of the training videos in the course, so you can walk through the
code tag-by-tag if you like along with the course.

I hope you find this repository and the companion course useful.  If you do, I
encourage you to check out other courses, training, and projects that I do. :wink:
